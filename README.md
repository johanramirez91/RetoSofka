# RetoSofka
Please read the following instructions before you try this game:

I added some of my image processing skills to the development of this challenge to give it something unique, I hope you like it.

1. There are 3 files in this repository and one folder of screenshots.
2. The Questions.csv file stores 25 questions in intervals of 5, each interval corresponds to a level, 1 to 5 First level, 6 to 10 Second level and so on.
3. The Players.csv file saves the player name, last name and score of the current player.
4. In Requirements.txt file you will see the libraries and dependencies required for run the game.
5. The main.py file is all the code for run the game.

Finally, how this game works:

When you run the file main.py you must type your name and last name in the console and then you will see something like this:

As you can see, the program detects the hands, through them we are going to select the answer to each question in the following way:

1. you must be at least 50 cm from the screen.
2. try to copy with one of your hands the way the hands are shown in the above picture.
3. to select an answer you should move your hands with the :v: gesture and then join index and middle fingers just like this :arrow_heading_down: :

4. Once you have selected an answer it's required you separed the fingers again :v:

If your answer is incorrect you will see this message in screen :arrow_heading_down: :

But if your answer is correct you going to the next level question:

The maximum score is 250, which you will achieve by answering 5 questions, 1 per level so... go for it and enjoy.
