Please read the following instructions before you try this game:

I added some of my image processing skills to the development of this challenge to give it something unique, I hope you like it.

1. There are 3 files in this repository and one folder of screenshots.
2. The Questions.csv file stores 25 questions in intervals of 5, each interval corresponds to a level, 1 to 5 First level, 6 to 10 Second level and so on.
3. The Players.csv file saves the player name, last name and score of the current player.
4. In Requirements.txt file you will see the libraries and dependencies required for run the game.
5. The main.py file is all the code for run the game.

Finally, how this game works:

When you run the file main.py you must type your name and last name and then you will see something like this:
